This is my first project using react.
Honestly, it has not been easy but I am enjoying the process. Clearly, I have a lot to learn but I am excited to learn more.
The weather app may seem basic but for a beginner like me, it is a big deal. I am proud of myself.
I cannot wait to work on more projects and learn more about react.
